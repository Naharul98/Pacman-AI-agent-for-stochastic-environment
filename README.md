# Pacman-AI-agent-for-stochastic-environment
A Markov Decision Process (MDP) based implementation of a Pacman agent, to survive and battle through a handicapped stochastic environment

> The code of the PACMAN AI agent implemented by myself is located in the MDPAgents.py file. The rest of the code (consisting of the actual implementation of the game, GUI, Ghost AI) was taken from the following link - http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

### Instructions for running the project:
```
# run in small grid layout
python pacman.py -q -n 1 -p MDPAgent -l smallGrid 

# run in mediumClassic grid layout
python pacman.py -q -n 1 -p MDPAgent -l mediumClassic
```
